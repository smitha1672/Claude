**Embedded Software Engineer**

Takes end-to-end ownership of the development and delivery of firmware and hardware solutions, ensuring high performance, reliability, and seamless integration throughout the product lifecycle.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- **Firmware Architecture & Development**
  - Architect, implement, and maintain embedded firmware for microcontrollers and SoCs, optimizing for performance, reliability, and low-power operation.
  - Collaborate with cross-functional teams to define firmware requirements, design modular software frameworks, and validate functionality through unit and integration tests.

- **Hardware Bring‑Up & Debugging**
  - Lead hardware validation and bring-up activities, leveraging oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, and in-circuit debuggers to diagnose and resolve electrical, timing, and layout issues.
  - Develop automated test scripts and hardware test benches to accelerate validation and regression testing.

- **System Troubleshooting & Root‑Cause Analysis**
  - Investigate complex hardware‑software interactions and perform in-depth root‑cause analysis to identify and remediate reliability and performance issues.
  - Implement corrective actions and preventive measures, documenting findings to drive continuous improvement.

- **Cross‑Functional Collaboration & Manufacturing Coordination**
  - Act as the primary liaison between R&D, production, and quality teams to streamline manufacturing processes and uphold rigorous quality standards.
  - Provide design-for-manufacturability guidance, support line fault analysis, and enable rapid issue resolution during pilot and production runs.

- **Documentation & Knowledge Sharing**
  - Create and maintain clear, comprehensive technical documentation, including schematics, flowcharts, test plans, and release notes.
  - Mentor junior engineers through code reviews, technical workshops, and hands‑on training sessions to foster team growth and knowledge transfer.
